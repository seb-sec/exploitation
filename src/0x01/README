This program uses gets() and has a shell function, however you are not given the address of this function.
Exploit these weaknesses and find the appropriate address to jump to

You will need to disable ASLR for this exercise. You can do so temporarily with the following:
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
To re-enable ASLR:
echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

The task:
i) Find the address of the shell() function- dissasembly with gdb might be helpful
ii) Overflow the buffer and set the return address to that of shell().
